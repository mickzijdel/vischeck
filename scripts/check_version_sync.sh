# Assert that every place a toolchain or service version is pinned agrees.
#
# A version gets spelled out in several files because different consumers read different ones:
# mise.toml drives local dev (and mise-action in CI), .ruby-version / .node-version /
# .python-version feed setup-ruby / setup-node / setup-python, the Dockerfile ARGs build the
# production image, package.json's `packageManager` field drives corepack, mise.lock records the
# exact release a floating mise.toml spec resolves to, and the `image:` tags
# in a compose file or config/deploy.yml decide what production runs versus what CI tests
# against. Nothing makes them agree on its own, so a bump that misses one file is silent: the
# image builds on a different Ruby than the tests ran on, or the suite goes green against a
# database server nobody deploys.
#
# Part of the dev-env standard (dev-hooks:dev-env-setup, v27) — run by the hk `versions` step and
# CI's `versions` job so the local and CI gates can't drift. Don't hand-edit the logic; the next
# policy change should be a plain re-copy of the template (a repo's own formatter may re-indent
# this file to local style, which is fine).
#
# Only files that exist get checked, and every skip is printed: a repo legitimately without a
# Dockerfile or a compose file passes, but its pass never looks like more coverage than it is.
# The gate reports and never rewrites a pin — which file holds the correct value is a judgement
# call (in one repo the right fix was to change production, not CI).
#
# Deliberately NOT checked: go.mod's `go` directive. It declares the *minimum* language version
# the module builds with, not the toolchain a build pins, so it is routinely — and correctly —
# older than mise.toml's `go`. Comparing them would fail healthy repos.
#
# Deliberately NOT enforced: Dockerfile style. Whether an image hardcodes `ARG NODE_VERSION` or
# derives the Node major from .node-version is a per-repo choice. This verifies that whatever
# pins exist agree, so adopting the standard never forces a Dockerfile rewrite.
#
# EVERY Dockerfile in the repo root is checked, not just the first one found. A repo
# commonly carries a production `Dockerfile` beside a `Dockerfile.dev`, and stopping at the first
# is how one of them sat on node:22 for months while .node-version, mise.toml and the production
# Dockerfile all said 24 — with this gate green the whole time, in the repo whose own docs claimed
# Node 24 "everywhere".
#
# CI's own setup steps are checked too: agreeing files prove nothing if the job that runs the
# tests installs some other version (see "CI setup steps" below).
